Title:
Graph Neural Networks for Enhancing Sentiment Analysis

Abstract:
In this study, we want to introduce a novel approach to sentiment analysis by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), specifically Graph Attention Networks (GAT), with traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By focusing on the challenges of interpreting long-range dependencies within text, particularly in the context of social media interactions, we propose a model that leverages the relational and textual information present in data from college SubReddit forums before and during the COVID-19 pandemic(Yan and Liu 2021). Our methodology employs RoBERTa for text embedding, followed by a GAT to incorporate the structural relationships between messages, enhancing the sentiment analysis capability beyond the limitations of conventional models. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in identifying and relating sentiments across distant text parts, underscoring the potential of GNNs in capturing complex interactions within text data. This research contributes to the evolving field of sentiment analysis by showcasing the effectiveness of combining GNNs with existing NLP frameworks, offering insights into the nuanced emotional landscape of digital communications during a global crisis.
